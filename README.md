### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Renato, a Junior Javascript Developer

I am passionate about programming, I like to find the logic to solve problems and in a short time.

After a 480 hours course, I have achieved excellent results and good comments from mentors: from scratch I acquired an excellent knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript , Vue.js, React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js.

After the course, I did 2 projects for myself: My Recipes (PWA in React to share "family's" recipes) and My Movies DB (React Native App for movies and series archive).

I am a person with a sense of humor, able to work in a team and listen / propose ideas to improve and simplify things. I am a dreamer, with imagination but capable of specifying solutions to briefly solve complex situations.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning..as it never ends..
